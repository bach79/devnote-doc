Project Main Folder Creation
============================



In order to have a working design for a new project are required the following files and folders.

In the 'main' folder create the following folder structure:

[<pjt_cd>]
    Default.jsp
    Title.jsp
    Top.jsp
    [include]
        [js]
            left_navigation.js
            top_navigation.js
        [css]
            main.css // this is the stylesheet for the main page if required!
            
[NOTE This is a temporary solution and this is the strict necessary to have a working design. ]
[NOTE The stylesheet for the project can be made in the ext folder ( ext/style/maindesigns ). ]


For a working example see SANGAH folder in the main folder.
